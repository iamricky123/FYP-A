HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

One of these flags is known as the `secure` flag. When the secure flag is set,
the browser will prevent it from being sent over a clear text channel (HTTP) and
only allow it to be sent when an encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).

Arachni discovered that a cookie was set by the server without the secure flag
being set. Although the initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS
connection, any HTTP link to the same server will result in the cookie being
send in clear text.
</p><p class='solution'>Cookies must be marked as secure and only be transmitted if the communications channel with the host is a secure one.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).
</p><p class='solution'>Implement HttpOnly Cookies in the application to prevent the session cookie being theft or modified by malicious script.
