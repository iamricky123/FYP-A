Due to the requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, many
rely on a database backend to store data that will be called upon and processed
by the web application (or other programs).
Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as Arachni was able to cause the server to respond to
the request with a database related error.
