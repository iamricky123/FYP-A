The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed. To keep data
private and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often tunnelled through
either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used, it is referred to as HTTPS.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an optional response header that can be
configured on the server to instruct the browser to only communicate via HTTPS.
This will be enforced by the browser even if the user requests a HTTP resource
on the same server.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise sensitive information passed
from the client to the server using HTTP. This can be conducted via various
Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or through network packet captures.

Arachni discovered that the affected application is using HTTPS however does not
use the HSTS header.

Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing)
is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different
from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing
confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on
seemingly innocuous web pages.

The server didn't return an `X-Frame-Options` header which means that this website
could be at risk of a clickjacking attack.

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not
a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can
use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not
embedded into other sites.

HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

One of these flags is known as the `secure` flag. When the secure flag is set,
the browser will prevent it from being sent over a clear text channel (HTTP) and
only allow it to be sent when an encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).

Arachni discovered that a cookie was set by the server without the secure flag
being set. Although the initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS
connection, any HTTP link to the same server will result in the cookie being
send in clear text.
</p><p class='solution'>Cookies must be marked as secure and only be transmitted if the communications channel with the host is a secure one.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).
